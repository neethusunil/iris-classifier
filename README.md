# iris-classifier

The dataset consists of four attributes: sepal-width, sepal-length, petal-width and petal-length. These are the attributes of specific types of iris plant. The task is to predict the class to which these plants belong. There are three classes in the dataset: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.


Uses K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm

The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning algorithms. KNN is extremely easy to implement in its most basic form, and yet performs quite complex classification tasks. It is a lazy learning algorithm since it doesn't have a specialized training phase. Rather, it uses all of the data for training while classifying a new data point or instance. KNN is a non-parametric learning algorithm, which means that it doesn't assume anything about the underlying data.
